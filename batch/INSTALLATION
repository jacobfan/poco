== Configure Hive ==
Currently, we use standalone hadoop, so we need to do following configuration:
environment variables:
    HIVE_HOME, HADOOP_HOME

Hadoop:
    make sure it is configured as in standalone mode.
    mapred.job.tracker=local
    mapred.local.dir

Hive configuration:
    and how to make it use another tmp dir instead of /tmp?
    hive.metastore.warehouse.dir

== Start Hive Server ==
<hive installation>/bin/hive --service hiveserver

put "<hive installation>/lib/py" on the python path.
